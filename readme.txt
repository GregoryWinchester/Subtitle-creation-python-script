This script allows you to take a file of subtitles separated by
newlines and dynamically add timestamps through user input by 
following along with the audio.

Run the script at the same time as you start the video.

To instantiate the start time of the first subtitle, input a null.
Once the first piece of subtitle dialogue is complete, input any string
(I just pick a letter).  This will write the first chunk of the .srt file.

If there is a pause in between two subtitle lines, press enter when the dialogue
starts again.
